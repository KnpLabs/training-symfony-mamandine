# Paginate your search page

## Description

To be able to find easily a cake in a large collection of cakes, we will create a pagination in the search page.

### TODO

- Change `CakeFixtures` to populate your database with 1000 cakes
- Create a new template file for the search page
- Below the list of cake, add a pagination component to go to the previous page and the next page

**Tip**: The page will be given through query parameter like the search term.

### Documentation

Create a pagination component with Bootstrap documentation: [Pagination](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/pagination/)
